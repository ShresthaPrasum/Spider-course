      <h2>Where chess began</h2>
      <p>Chess came from an old game in India called chaturanga around the 500s or 600s CE. The game moved to Persia and was called shatranj. Later it spread to the Muslim world, then to Europe and Russia.</p>

      <h3>Change to modern rules</h3>
      <p>In Europe, around the 1400s, some pieces changed moves. The queen and bishop became stronger. This change made the game faster and led to the modern game.</p>

      <h3>Chess and ideas</h3>
      <p>Chess has been part of books, art, and science. In recent years it also helped computer researchers. Strong computer programs can check many moves very fast.</p>
